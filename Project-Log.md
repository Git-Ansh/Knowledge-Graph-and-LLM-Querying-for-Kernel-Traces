### Key Findings & Results:
- Successfully set up the complete development environment for the project. The system is now ready for the initial data collection and exploration phase.
- **Expanded LTTng Skillset:** Moved from basic setup to practical application. Now capable of capturing targeted, filtered traces for both kernel and user-space events. This provides a solid foundation for analyzing application performance and behavior.
- **High-Volume Trace Analysis:** Successfully captured and analyzed 3.38M kernel events over 5 seconds, demonstrating system capability to handle intensive tracing workloads.
- **Event Pattern Recognition:** Identified key event categories with RCU operations dominating (28% of events), followed by scheduling statistics (13%) and cooperative scheduling patterns (11%).
- **Graph Schema Foundation:** Documented critical event types and relationships for knowledge graph implementation, including process lifecycle, syscall patterns, memory management, and inter-process communication structures.
- **Analysis Infrastructure:** Established `observations/` directory with structured documentation approach for ongoing trace analysis and findings.
- **Database Debugging Infrastructure:** Built comprehensive database troubleshooting and inspection capabilities:

  - Achieved seamless Neo4j connectivity with robust error handling and authentication
  - Developed automated schema validation proving the design supports all required query patterns
- **[COMPLETED] Schema Validation:** Successfully validated kernel trace knowledge graph schema:
  - Implemented representative scenario (bash→ls→/etc/passwd) with 5 nodes and 4 relationships
  - Validated 6 critical query patterns: parent processes, file access, timelines, and complex analytics
  - Proved schema capabilities for process trees, security analysis, forensics, and performance tracking
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure:** Database tools are organized, documented, and ready for LTTng integration:
  - Self-contained output management prevents project clutter
  - Automated validation scripts ensure schema consistency
  - Context generation tools enable efficient debugging and troubleshooting of database issues

### Problems & Blockers:
- Initially faced issues with missing build-tools (`gcc-12 not found`) but resolved it by reinstalling the `build-essential` package. Also resolved VM performance and full-screen issues by installing and configuring VirtualBox Guest Additions.
- **LTTng Permission Issue:** Encountered "Can't find valid lttng config" error when using `sudo lttng enable-event` after creating session as regular user. **Solution:** Kernel tracing requires root privileges, so the entire session must be created and managed as root user using `sudo lttng create` followed by `sudo` for all subsequent commands.
- **Trace Data Overload:** Realized that a simple trace captures an enormous volume of events, making manual analysis difficult. **Solution:** Developed strategies to manage this complexity, first with `grep` for quick analysis, and then with LTTng's `--filter` capability for efficient, targeted captures.
- **GitHub File Size Limit**: Initial attempt to commit trace files failed due to 100+ MB file size limits. **Solution**: Created comprehensive `.gitignore` to exclude trace files and other generated data from version control, as these are artifacts rather than source code.
- **Neo4j Database Connectivity:** Initially encountered connection refused errors and authentication failures. **Solution:** Properly started Neo4j Desktop application and identified correct database credentials (`sudoroot` password).
- **APOC Procedure Dependency:** Database inspector failed due to missing APOC procedures. **Solution:** Refactored all queries to use standard Cypher without APOC dependencies for broader compatibility.
- **JSON Serialization Issues:** Context generator failed when serializing Neo4j DateTime objects. **Solution:** Implemented custom JSON serializer to handle Neo4j temporal types properly.

### Plan for Next Week (Week 3):
- [COMPLETED] ~~Install Neo4j and complete its introductory tutorial~~ (COMPLETED)
- [COMPLETED] ~~Begin designing the trace data to graph schema mapping~~ (COMPLETED - Schema validated!)
