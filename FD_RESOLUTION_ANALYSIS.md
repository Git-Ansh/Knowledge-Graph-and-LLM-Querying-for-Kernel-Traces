# File Descriptor Resolution Issue - Analysis

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Executive Summary
After testing with both Redis (without LTTng context) and FileOps (with LTTng context fields), the file isolation problem persists. **95% of EventSequences use `fd:N` format** instead of actual file paths, preventing File-EventSequence relationships from being created.

## Root Cause Confirmed
The issue is NOT trace-specific or application-specific. It's a **fundamental limitation in event_sequence_builder.py**:

### How File I/O Works in Linux:
1. **open("/path/to/file")** → kernel returns **fd 3** (file descriptor number)
2. **read(fd=3, buf, size)** → read from file descriptor 3
3. **write(fd=3, buf, size)** → write to file descriptor 3  
4. **close(fd=3)** → close file descriptor 3

### What We Currently Do:
- `entity_extractor.py` creates `File` nodes from `open` syscalls: path="/tmp/test_file_0.txt"
- `event_sequence_builder.py` creates `EventSequence` nodes from `read/write` syscalls: entity_target="fd:3"
- `graph_builder.py` tries to match File.path with EventSequence.entity_target
- **Result**: NO MATCH - "fd:3" ≠ "/tmp/test_file_0.txt"

## Test Results

### Test 1: Redis Trace (WITHOUT LTTng Context Fields)
- Trace captured: October 3, 2025 @ 18:59
- Events: 2,627,034
- EventSequences: 6,777
  - **Isolated**: 0 (0%) ✓ FIXED via CPU context tracking
  - File paths: ~3% 
  - FD references: ~97%
- Files: 1,343
  - **Isolated**: 1,304 (97.1%) ✗ STILL BROKEN
- Threads: 894
  - Unknown names: 798 (89.3%)

### Test 2: FileOps Trace (WITH LTTng Context Fields)
- Trace captured: October 3, 2025 @ 20:18
- Events: ~400,000 (smaller trace - only 7 phases of file operations)
- Context fields added: pid, tid, procname, ppid, prio, hostname, cpu_id, vpid, vtid
- EventSequences: 1,299
  - **Isolated**: 0 (0%) ✓ GOOD
  - File paths: 67 (5.2%)
  - FD references: 1,228 (94.8%)
- Files: 218
  - **Isolated**: 202 (92.7%) ✗ STILL BROKEN
- Threads: 807
  - Unknown names: 770 (95.4%) - worse because many short-lived processes

## Conclusion
Adding LTTng context fields via `lttng add-context` does NOT fix the file descriptor resolution problem. The issue is in our code logic, not the trace data.

## Solution Required
Implement fd→file mapping in `event_sequence_builder.py`:

```python
class EventSequenceBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        # Track per-process file descriptor tables
        # Key: (pid, fd), Value: file_path
        self.fd_map: Dict[tuple, str] = {}
    
    def _pair_syscalls(self, syscalls):
        for pair in pairs:
            if pair['syscall'] in ('open', 'openat'):
                # Capture fd from exit return value
                fd = pair['exit_data']['ret']
                if fd > 0:  # Success
                    file_path = pair['entry_data']['filename']
                    pid = pair['pid']
                    self.fd_map[(pid, fd)] = file_path
            
            elif pair['syscall'] in ('read', 'write', 'ioctl'):
                # Resolve fd to file path
                fd = pair['entry_data']['fd']
                pid = pair['pid']
                file_path = self.fd_map.get((pid, fd), f"fd:{fd}")
                # Use file_path as entity_target instead of fd:N
            
            elif pair['syscall'] == 'close':
                # Clean up fd mapping
                fd = pair['entry_data']['fd']
                pid = pair['pid']
                self.fd_map.pop((pid, fd), None)
```

## Expected Impact After Fix
- File isolation: **92.7% → <10%**
- WAS_TARGET_OF relationships: **~50 → ~1,200+**
- EventSequence file paths: **5.2% → ~95%**

## Files Modified So Far

### src/trace_parser.py ✓
- Added `tid_context` and `cpu_context` for tracking thread information
- Implemented `_update_context()` to extract context from scheduling events
- Modified `_parse_line()` to enrich syscalls with CPU-based context
- **Result**: 99.9% of events now have valid PID/TID/process names

### benchmarks/benchmark_tracer.py ✓
- Added LTTng context fields (pid, tid, procname, etc.) to trace capture
- Added "fileops" benchmark configuration  
- Implemented `workload_only` flag for completion-based workloads
- **Result**: Traces now include context on all events

### benchmarks/file_operations_test.py ✓
- Created comprehensive file I/O benchmark
- 7 phases: create, read, stat, append, copy, read-copied, delete
- 20 files per phase with clear operation patterns
- **Result**: Clean, focused trace for testing fd resolution

## Next Actions

### Priority 1: Implement FD Tracking
**File**: `src/event_sequence_builder.py`
**Lines**: ~200-350 (in `_pair_syscalls` method)
**Complexity**: Medium - need to handle edge cases:
- Multiple processes with same fd number
- fd reuse after close
- fork() creating child processes with inherited fds
- Failed open calls (ret < 0)

### Priority 2: Test FD Resolution
**Steps**:
1. Run pipeline on fileops trace
2. Query graph for File isolation %
3. Verify WAS_TARGET_OF relationships
4. Check entity_target values in EventSequences

### Priority 3: Handle Edge Cases
- Socket fds: Some fds are sockets, not files
- Pipe fds: Pipes also use fds
- Special fds: stdin (0), stdout (1), stderr (2)
- Anonymous fds: Some operations create fds without open (e.g., eventfd)

## Performance Considerations
- `fd_map` dictionary size: O(number of open files across all processes)
- Typical desktop: 100-1000 open fds
- Our traces: ~1,000-2,000 unique (pid, fd) combinations
- Memory impact: Negligible (<1MB)
- Lookup performance: O(1) dictionary access

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Post-process JSON files
- Pro: No need to modify core pipeline
- Con: Requires re-parsing all syscalls
- Con: Loses temporal ordering information

### Option B: Use /proc/PID/fd directory
- Pro: Could resolve fds at trace time
- Con: Requires live process access (not available in traces)
- Con: Race conditions if process exits

### Option C: LTTng custom probes
- Pro: Could add fd→file mapping to trace itself
- Con: Requires kernel module compilation
- Con: Not portable across systems

**Selected**: Implement fd tracking in event_sequence_builder (most practical)
